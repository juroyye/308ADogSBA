The adoption page offers the option of adopting a variety of dog breeds from the dropdown. The possibility exists to obtain information and pick a breed by selecting some options. The src folder houses all possible dog breeds, as demonstrated by several thumbnails and listings. This is supposed to be a well-structured and simple application design. Characteristics Adopt an animal - Pick from a variety of dog breeds to adopt a dog. Breed-based Profiles - Engage in adoption of a specific breed.
